### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, thanks for landing on github profile.

My name is Pride, however, I like to call myself Mr. Robot, Iâ€™m also the dude that owns the lazydude.co domain.
I am a multi-discipline Software Engineer, whoâ€™s not afraid to get my hands dirty, I have worked with a lot of technologies some that Iâ€™m not proud of .e.g PHP :).
  
I have experience in most Frontend frameworks and cross-platform mobile Frameworks (handlebars, knockoutJS, VueJS, AngularJS, Flutter) however ReactJS and React Native have won my heart... probably because Facebook indoctrinated me at [F8](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2019/05/16/F8-2019-hackathon-winners-announced/) ðŸ¤“.

***When Iâ€™m not debugging in production you will find me on my Onewheel, please visit the link below maybe you will discover something cool, do hit me up for a ride when you get one :)***

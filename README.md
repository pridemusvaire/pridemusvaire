## üöÄ About Me

I'm a multi-disciplinary Software Engineer with a passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions. With experience across various technologies and frameworks, I specialize in React and React Native development. My journey in tech has led me from Facebook's [F8 hackathon](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2019/05/16/F8-2019-hackathon-winners-announced/) to building exciting apps that solve real-world problems.

As a part-time digital nomad, I thrive on working from diverse, inspiring locations that fuel my creativity. This flexible lifestyle allows me to bring fresh perspectives to my projects and stay inspired in both my work and personal life.
